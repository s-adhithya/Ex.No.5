# EX-5 Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test scenerios

# Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
     Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

# Objective
To compare how different prompting patterns affect the performance of AI models in terms of quality, accuracy, and depth of responses.

## Scenario: "I am struggling with managing my time effectively. Can you help me improve my time management skills?"
### 1. The Persona Pattern
Prompt: "Imagine you are a productivity coach, how would you help someone improve their time management skills?"

Output: "As a productivity coach, I would first start by understanding your goals and challenges. We would then identify time-wasting activities, prioritize your tasks, and create a schedule that balances productivity with rest. Using tools like the Pomodoro technique and setting specific, achievable goals for each day would help keep you on track."

### 2. Zero-shot Prompting
Prompt: "Help me improve my time management skills."

Output: "To improve time management, you should start by organizing your day into blocks of focused work and scheduled breaks. Prioritize tasks based on importance and deadlines. Additionally, setting goals each day and evaluating your progress at the end of the day can help maintain productivity."

### 3. Few-shot Prompting
Prompt: "Here are some time management strategies:

Prioritize your tasks

Break large tasks into smaller chunks

Set specific deadlines Can you suggest more strategies?"

Output: "Certainly! You could also try using the 'Two-Minute Rule'—if a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Another strategy is 'time blocking,' where you assign specific time slots to certain tasks to prevent multitasking. Lastly, reflect on your work weekly to assess and adjust your strategies."

### 4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Prompt: "What steps should I take to improve time management?"

Output: "First, assess how you spend your time daily. Next, identify which activities are unproductive or time-consuming. Once you know what to avoid, prioritize your tasks by importance. Afterward, set realistic goals, and schedule time for each task. Lastly, regularly check in with your progress to adjust as needed."

### 5. Active-prompt
Prompt: "Give me a list of specific actions to improve my time management skills."

Output: "1. List all your tasks and categorize them into urgent and non-urgent. 2. Set daily, weekly, and monthly goals. 3. Block out time for focused work and relaxation. 4. Track your time using an app or calendar. 5. Reflect at the end of each day and week to assess progress and adjust accordingly."

### 6. Directional Stimulus Prompting
Prompt: "You're about to start a busy day. What should you do first to manage your time effectively?"

Output: "Begin by making a list of all your tasks for the day. Then, prioritize them based on deadlines and importance. Allocate time slots for each task and avoid multitasking. Start with the most important task, and break it into smaller tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed."

### 7. Graph Prompting
Prompt: "Create a visual graph that helps me manage my time better."

Output: "The graph could look like this: a bar chart with 'Time Spent' on the y-axis and 'Task Categories' on the x-axis. The categories could include 'Work,' 'Rest,' 'Personal Tasks,' etc. You would plot time spent in each category to visually identify time allocation and adjust accordingly."

### 8. Reverse-Engineered Prompt Generation
Prompt: "Tell me the steps to improve time management, starting from the outcome of having a balanced, productive day."

Output: "To achieve a balanced and productive day, you must first plan your day ahead of time. Identify your goals, schedule focused work sessions, and ensure you leave time for breaks. You need to reflect on your progress each day, and at the end of the week, review your accomplishments and adjust your strategy accordingly."

### 9. Multilingual and Multimodal Prompt Engineering
Prompt: "Can you explain time management strategies in both English and Spanish?"

Output:

English: "Effective time management includes setting clear goals, prioritizing tasks, and scheduling regular breaks. The Pomodoro technique and time blocking are great methods to stay focused."

Spanish: "La gestión efectiva del tiempo incluye establecer metas claras, priorizar tareas y programar descansos regulares. La técnica Pomodoro y el bloque de tiempo son excelentes métodos para mantenerse enfocado."
